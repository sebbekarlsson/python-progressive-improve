## Progressive improvement of a Python program
> You can see each solution in the numbered folders in this repository.  
> This repository was created for educational purposes while teaching Python.

### Problem
> The problem the solutions are trying to solve, is to convert a list of numbers
> into sums of pairs.  
> For example:
```python
[
  5,
  3,
  8,
  2,
  1,
  1
]
```
> The list above should be converted to:
```python
[
  8,
  10,
  2
]
```
> Because:
```python
5 + 3 = 8
8 + 2 = 10
1 + 1 = 2
```
